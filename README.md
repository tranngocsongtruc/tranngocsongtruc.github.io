# trucs-portfolio-web
A website to showcase my contributions
# PREPARE

1. Create the portfolio website repo on GitHub
2. Create the main folder `TRUCS-PORTFOLIO-WEB`

In the main folder `TRUCS-PORTFOLIO-WEB`, create two folders—`img` and `styles`—then create a file—`index.html`. 

In the folder `styles`, create the file `styles.scss`. The reason to use SCSS (sass preprocessor) is, that it is much quicker to do styles than the normal CSS.

Then the folder tree looks like below:

1. In “Extensions” the left bar:
    - Find and install “Sass” and “Live Sass Compiler”
        - Live Sass Compiler: so we do not need to restart every time we make updates to the code. So we can just compiler the code live.
    - Find and install “HTML CSS Support” and “HTML snippets”
    1. Create some basic code in index.html to test if styles.scss works by put “!” in index.html then hold “Shift” and press “Enter”. Then click on “Watch Sass” at the bottom of the screen.
